# Decision-Tree-from-scratch
Decision Tree has been implemented from scratch.


Decision Tree has been implemented to predict prices for the given dataset using available features.Some attributes are categorical while others are continuos.
Values missing in categorical features have been replaced by mode and continous ones have been replaced by mean.
Minimum Mean Squared error has been used to split the node.
